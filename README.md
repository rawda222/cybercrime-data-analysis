# Cybercrime Incident Data Analysis (Excel & SQL)

## 1. Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing a cybercrime incident dataset using **Excel** and **SQL**.  
The aim is to clean, preprocess, and analyze data to uncover attack patterns, identify the most targeted industries, evaluate attack outcomes, and recommend effective defense strategies.  
Additionally, an **interactive Excel dashboard** with KPIs and filters will be developed to support decision-making.


## 2. Project Understanding
Cybercrime incidents are increasing globally, targeting critical industries such as healthcare, finance, and government.  
Although organizations adopt security measures (e.g., firewalls, MFA, IDS), attackers still find ways to succeed.  
This project transforms raw cybercrime data into actionable insights using **Excel and SQL**, making it practical and accessible for organizations without advanced tools.


## 3. Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure consistency.  
- Perform descriptive analysis of incidents by attack type, industry, and geography.  
- Write SQL queries for grouping, filtering, and extracting insights.  
- Model attack success factors using Excel PivotTables and charts.  
- Build an interactive Excel dashboard with KPIs and filters.  
- Summarize findings and provide recommendations in a professional report.


## 4. Methodology
**Phase 1: Data Cleaning**  
- Remove duplicates, fix inconsistencies, and standardize categories.  
- Format dates and ensure consistent labeling of industries/countries.  

**Phase 2: SQL Analysis**  
- Group incidents by attack type, industry, and country.  
- Analyze outcomes (success vs. failure).  
- Identify top targeted industries and successful attack methods.  

**Phase 3: Excel Modeling**  
- Use PivotTables and charts for descriptive insights.  
- Apply conditional formatting for quick visualization.  
- Build KPIs (total incidents, success rate, most attacked industry).  

**Phase 4: Dashboard Creation**  
- Interactive Excel dashboard with slicers (filters).  
- Charts: bar, pie, trend lines.  

**Phase 5: Reporting**  
- Final report with key findings and recommendations.  


## 5. Dataset
- **Source**: Provided dataset (extendable with Kaggle or open data).  
- **Size**: ~100000 incidents.  
- **Key Attributes**:  
  - Attack Type (Phishing, SQL Injection, DDoS, Ransomware, etc.)  
  - Target (Database, User Account, Web Server, etc.)  
  - Outcome (Success / Failure)  
  - Industry (Healthcare, Finance, Government, etc.)  
  - Country  
  - Security Control (Firewall, MFA, IDS, etc.)  
  - Response Action (Patch, Quarantine, Block IP, etc.)  


## 6. Tools & Technologies
- **Excel** ‚Üí Data cleaning, PivotTables, dashboards, KPIs  
- **SQL (MySQL / SQL Server)** ‚Üí Querying, grouping, filtering, aggregation  
- **Word/PDF** ‚Üí Reporting and documentation  


## 7. Deliverables
- Cleaned dataset (Excel file).  
- SQL scripts with analysis queries.  
- Excel dashboard with KPIs and interactive filters.  
- Final report (Word/PDF).  
- Presentation slides for project defense.  


## 8. Project Timeline

**Total Duration: ~4.5 weeks**


## 9. Expected Outcomes
- Cleaned and well-structured dataset.  
- Insights into attack patterns and success factors.  
- Interactive Excel dashboard with KPIs and filters.  
- Professional final report with recommendations.  
- Cost-effective solution using accessible tools.  


## 10. Conclusion
This project demonstrates how organizations can analyze cybercrime data effectively using only **Excel & SQL**.  
By uncovering attack patterns and risk factors, the analysis provides valuable insights for decision-makers and helps strengthen cybersecurity strategies.
